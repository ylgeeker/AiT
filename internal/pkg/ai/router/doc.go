// Package router contains the receiver-free building blocks of the AiT AI
// multi-provider router: the failover Chain of Responsibility helpers
// (ResolveTryOrder, AggregateErrors, LogFailover, APIKeyHint)
// and the tiered routing classifier (ClassifyPrompt) shared by the cloud and
// local-first paths.
//
// The Strategy choice (OpenAI vs Anthropic API style per provider endpoint)
// stays in the client subpackage because the strategy implementations are
// receiver methods on the (unexported) endpoint type.
